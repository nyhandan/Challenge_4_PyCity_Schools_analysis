# Challenge 4: PyCity Schools Analysis
Attempt 1 by Dan Nyhan

Deliverables 1 and 2 found in my ["PyCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb" file](https://github.com/nyhandan/Challenge_4_PyCity_Schools_analysis/blob/main/Challenge_4/PyCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb)

## Purpose
A school board requested a test score analysis for each high school and for the whole district of numerous high schools. Math and reading test scores were used, but, the school board presents evidence of academic dishonesty from Thomas High School's ninth graders.  The first deliverable of the analysis takes out those students' scores using the Pandas "loc" method with conditional statements and comparison and logical operators. We then used the Pandas NumPy module to change the reading and math scores to NaN. After replacing these math and reading scores, we repeated the school district analysis that we did in this module and had written up this report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

For Deliverable 2, we repeated the school district analysis from this module, and recreated the following metrics:

- The district summary
- The school summary
- The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
- The average math score for each grade level from each school
- The average reading score for each grade level from each school
- The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type
